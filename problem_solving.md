# Problem Solving

1-> Use the defining features of the setup
	-> Look at the problem, ask critical questions on definations of each term, try to see where all of it makes sense.

2-> Give things meaningful names.

3-> Try describing one object two different ways (More solutions to same problems.)

4-> Draw a picture [make a sketch]

5-> Ask a simpler version of the problem.

6-> Read a lot, and think about problems a lot.

7-> Always gut check your answer.
