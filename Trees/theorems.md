# Theorems.

node/vertices
The depth of a node is its level number. The height of a tree is the maximum level of any
node in this tree
A tree with n nodes has (n-1) edges.
For a tree (T), there is one and only one path between every pair of vertices in a tree.
Any two vertices of graph T are connected by exactly one path.
The maximum number of all nodes in a tree of height h is 2h+1 - 1
The maximum number of nodes at level ‘L’ in a binary tree is 2^L , where L>=0. 
If a binary tree of height h has l leaves, ththen h >= logl
