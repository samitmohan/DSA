// Notes
-------------------------

unsigned variables -> Can hold any positive numbers
signed variables -> Can hold both negative and positive values
iostream -> Class
cin -> Object

Class -> Map of house.
House -> Object

Question on Sorting (Merge Sort)

4GB Data -> Unsorted
Need to sort it in an array of 1 GB data (all of it)

Ans -> Divide 4Gb 4 blocks into 1 GB each (file 1, file 2, file3, file4)
    Store 1GB data in each of them.

    In the 1GB (where we want to sort) block, divide it the same way into five 200 MB blocks
    Sort the data and pick the first number in each block and store it in the RAM (smallest number)


-----------------------
Question on Arrays

Product of an array without using itself -> {10,20,30,40} -> create a new array -> 0th index ko chorhke, baaki sabke product -> {24000, 12000, 8000, 6000}
Complexity -> O(n)

One method: 
multiply all and then divide by the number


------------------------
Difference between push_back and emplace_back
which one is fas? depends on the input
are they same or diff? sometimes

works exactly the same on inbuilt data type, int, float, long -> all same
BUT
for user defined data, emplace_back is faster (using classes etc)


    // Push_back
    1) make dummy object somewhere in the memory
    2) copies the dummy object to the og vector
    3) remove dummy object

    // emplace_back
    1) make object directly into the vector (so a bit faster)

// STL
Sort list in reverse order

bool cmp(int x, int y){
    return x>y;

}


int main(){
    sort(v.being(), v.end(), cmp);

}

--------------------------

PigeonHole principle
In any group of 366 people, there must be two people having the same birth- day: Since there are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years), it is not possible that the birthdays of 366 people are all distinct.
 
Pigeonhole Principle: Let k â‰¥ 1 be an integer. If k+1 or more objects are placed into k boxes, then there is at least one box containing two or more objects.
OR

If there are N items and M containers (N > M) then N/M is atleast 2.


Equivalently, if A and B are two finite sets with |A| > |B|, then there is no one-to-one function from A to B.
Question ->  A licence plate number consists of a sequence of four uppercase letters
followed by three digits. How many licence plate numbers are there?

---------------------------
Memory Allocation in C++

2 Types -> Static Memory Allocation and Dynamic Memory Allocation

Static/Compile Time -> Exact size and type of storage must be known at compile time. 
It forms a symbol table at compilation time. 
int a[100] // 400 bytes
int x // 4 bytes
char ch // 1 byte

Stored in RAM. Size/Location -> Fixed. Not flexible.

Dynamic/Running Time -> Memory created during run time. Flexible, exact amount of space or number of items does not have to be known by the computer in advance.

Pointers are crucial for DMA. Allocation / De-allocation is done by 2 commands.
// C compared to C++
new and delete (new = malloc / calloc (allocate single/multiple block of memory), delete = free())

Used to clean space being used by variables (De-allocation)

-------------------------

use "\n" rather than endl -> endl flushes the input
just like in terminal -> clear (clears the screen but you can still scroll up and see, "\n" works the same way)
where as endl acts like command K which flushes the screen. 

------------------------

To use pointers with vector, use .data()
vector<int> arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
int * p = arr;
cout << arr << endl #wont work

;; 

int * p = arr.data()
cout << *p << endl;

# Problem Solving

1-> Use the defining features of the setup
	-> Look at the problem, ask critical questions on definations of each term, try to see where all of it makes sense.

2-> Give things meaningful names.

3-> Try describing one object two different ways (More solutions to same problems.)

4-> Draw a picture [make a sketch]

5-> Ask a simpler version of the problem.

6-> Read a lot, and think about problems a lot.
		Pattern Recognition

7-> Always gut check your answer.
