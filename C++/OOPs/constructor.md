Suppose you went to a shop to buy a marker.
When you want to buy a marker, what are the options? The first one you go to a shop and say give me a marker. 
So just saying give me a marker mean that you did not set which brand name and which color,
you didn’t mention anything just say you want a marker. 
So when we said just I want a marker so whatever the frequently sold marker is there in the market or in his shop he will simply hand over that. 
And this is what a default constructor is! 

The second method you go to a shop and say I want a marker a red in color and XYZ brand. 
So you are mentioning this and he will give you that marker. So in this case you have given the parameters. 
And this is what a parameterized constructor is! 
Then the third one you go to a shop and say I want a marker like this(a physical marker on your hand). 
So the shopkeeper will see that marker. Okay, and he will give a new marker for you. So copy of that marker. And that’s what copy constructor is!

Constructor has same name as the class itself
Constructors don’t have return type
A constructor is automatically called when an object is created.
It must be placed in public section of class.
If we do not specify a constructor, C++ compiler generates a default constructor for object (expects no parameters and has an empty body).


# Why use constructor?

<!-- // Constructors = Why are we creating a constructor? Because data will be given in main function, hence it will be recognised in constructor
// Constructors initialize the new object, that is, they set the startup property values for the object. -->

object = new Class;
object.initialize();

You just call

object = new Class();
